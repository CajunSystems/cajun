 * Example demonstrating that the actor system keeps the JVM alive
 * after the main method completes, until system.shutdown() is called.
 * 
 * To test: Run this example and observe that it doesn't exit automatically.
 * The JVM will stay alive because the actor system has a non-daemon keep-alive thread.
 * You'll need to manually terminate the process (Ctrl+C) or wait for the shutdown.
