/**
 * This test demonstrates the performance difference between actors and threads
 * when accessing state. Actors maintain isolated state, while threads need to
 * synchronize access to shared state.
 * 
 * The test compares:
 * 1. Stateful actors that maintain their own isolated state
 * 2. Threads with synchronized access to shared state
 * 3. Threads with lock-based access to shared state
 * 4. Threads with unsynchronized access to shared state (unsafe)
